                    <p>Mistborn is a series of epic fantasy novels written by American author Brandon Sanderson and published by Tor Books. The first trilogy, published between 2006 and 2008, consists of The Final Empire, The Well of Ascension, and The Hero
                        of Ages. To prepare readers for the second series, Sanderson wrote a transitional sequel, The Alloy of Law, which then became the first installment in the Wax and Wayne tetralogy, set 300 years later. This was followed by Shadows
                        of Self, released on October 6, 2015; The Bands of Mourning, published on January 26, 2016; and The Lost Metal, to be written in the next few years. Sanderson also published a novella tied to the original trilogy, titled Mistborn:

                    <p>Discworld is a comic fantasy book series written by the English author Terry Pratchett, set on the Discworld, a flat planet balanced on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the back of a giant turtle. The series began
                        in 1983 with The Colour of Magic and continued until the final novel The Shepherd's Crown was published in 2015, following Pratchett's death. The books frequently parody or take inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien, Robert E. Howard,
                        H. P. Lovecraft, Charles Dickens and William Shakespeare, as well as mythology, folklore and fairy tales, often using them for satirical parallels with cultural, political and scientific issues</p>

                        (1999) and concluding with The Crippled God (2011). Erikson's series is extremely complex with a wide scope, and presents the narratives of a large cast of characters spanning thousands of years across multiple continents.</p>
